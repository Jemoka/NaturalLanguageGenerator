## The Natural Language Generator
The Natural Language Generator is an extendable NLP Class that is currently able to work with different algorithms to generate natural text. The package works with a simple Markov Chain right out of the box along with many more to come. It is also easy to be extended to (see ##Extensibility for more info) for any future projects.

## The Science Project
Based on this generator, the developer will train the module with two different corpuses -- one collected from the public and one prewritten -- and separately evaluate the performance, the grammatical accuracy and the comprehensiveness of the generated data. The results will be open-sourced in this repository.

## Extensibility
The system is well documented and easy to extend to. *{Extensibility info needed}* All data information can be stored and retrieved with a single object. The class is able to be pickled and stored into a binary file for later access. Please feel free to fork, edit, and open pull requests as needed.
